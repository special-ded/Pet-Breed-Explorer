ðŸ”§ Key Implementation Details

Data Fetching: Utilizes Next.js 15's enhanced fetch API with async/await in Server Components for efficient server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).

Dynamic Routing: Implements Next.js's dynamic routes (app/breed/[breedId]/page.tsx) to create a unique page for each breed based on its ID.

TypeScript Integration: Full type safety is enforced with custom interfaces for API responses (e.g., DogBreed, CatBreed), ensuring data structure consistency.

Responsive Grid: The homepage uses a responsive Tailwind CSS grid (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3) that adapts to different screen sizes.

Error Handling: API fetch calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks to gracefully handle potential network errors.
